- You can now save locations as **favorites**: open the map, move the marker and press "Spara Plats" — you'll be asked if you want to save it and can name the favorite. Use the dropdown next to the location label to jump to a saved favorite.
 - The default start position is automatically added to the favorites list.
 - You can edit or delete favorites from the main view, and favorites appear as quick buttons inside the map modal for fast selection.
 - Wind direction is now shown as small arrows on the top of the chart, giving a quick visual cue of wind direction at different times.
